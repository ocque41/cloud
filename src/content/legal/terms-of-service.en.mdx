## Acceptance and eligibility

By using any Cumulus product or service you accept these terms and confirm you are old enough to enter a binding agreement where you live. If you act for an organisation, you state you have authority to bind it.

## Services overview

The following catalogue shows every product and service that falls under these terms. It updates from a single source so nothing is missed.

## Accounts and access

Keep account details accurate and secure. You are responsible for actions taken under your credentials. Tell us right away if you suspect unauthorised access.

## Acceptable use

Do not misuse the services, disrupt infrastructure, abuse rate limits, or break the law. We may suspend or block access to protect the platform and other users.

## Third-party dependencies

Some features rely on processors such as Stripe, Neon (Postgres), Vercel Blob, and Supabase. Their terms apply in addition to ours when you use features powered by them. We are not responsible for outages caused by those providers.

## Plans, billing, and taxes

Pricing, billing cycles, and invoices follow the order form or proposal we share with you. Fees are non-refundable unless the agreement states otherwise. Taxes, duties, and bank charges are your responsibility unless local law requires us to collect them.

## Service levels and maintenance

We deliver services on a commercially reasonable basis. Planned maintenance windows and downtime notifications arrive through email or in-product messages. [Legal counsel placeholder: insert SLA commitments if applicable].

## Intellectual property and feedback

We own pre-existing IP, reusable components, and internal tooling. Project-specific deliverables transfer as described in the relevant contract. Feedback you share may be used to improve the services without obligation.

## Term, suspension, and termination

Either party may end the relationship according to the governing agreement. We may suspend or terminate access if you breach these terms, if payment is overdue, or if we must comply with law.

## Disclaimers and limitation of liability

The services are provided "as is" without warranties beyond those expressly stated. To the extent permitted by law, our liability is limited to the fees paid during the prior twelve months. [Legal counsel placeholder: insert negotiated limits].

## Governing law and venue

Spanish law governs these terms. Courts in Madrid, España have exclusive jurisdiction, unless a different venue is required by mandatory law.

## Changes to these terms

We may update these terms from time to time. We will post the new version here and notify you when important changes apply.

## Legal advice note

This document contains placeholders that counsel must fill with final language. It is not legal advice and should be reviewed by your lawyer.
