## Introduction and scope

This notice explains, in plain words, what information we handle when you use Cumulus products, services, projects, or support. It applies to the website, hosted tools, custom deliveries, and any engagement we run for clients and users.

## Controller identity and contacts

Cumulus S.L. is the data controller. Email `legal@cumulush.com` for general matters and `dpo@cumulush.com` for privacy requests. Our registered address appears in the main legal notice. [Legal counsel placeholder: add statutory controller wording].

## Data we collect

### Account and profile data
Names, emails, login details, and profile content you supply to set up and use our platforms.

### Usage and support data
Interactions with interfaces, product telemetry, tickets, and help conversations.

### Payment data
Payment method details handled by Stripe, including authorised methods, metadata, and fraud signals.

### Files and content
Uploads, documents processed, and outputs generated inside our tools or projects.

### Logs and diagnostics
Security events, audit logs, and error diagnostics that keep the service reliable.

## Why we process data

We process data to deliver contracts, provide support, improve our products, protect the platform, and meet legal duties. Consent covers optional cookies and promotional updates. Legitimate interests include safety, fraud control, and internal analytics. [Legal counsel placeholder: complete purpose and basis matrix].

## Processors and recipients

We rely on specialised processors that follow our instructions and data protection agreements. Review their roles, categories, and security statements below.

## International transfers and hosting

We aim to store data in the European Union whenever the stack allows. If a processor can operate outside the EEA, we rely on contracts and safeguards that keep rights protected. [Legal counsel placeholder: describe actual regions and transfer tools].

## Data retention

We retain information while you have an active relationship with Cumulus and for longer when law or audit duties require it. Retention periods cover projects, support records, payments, and compliance archives.

## Your rights

You can request access, correction, erasure, restriction, portability, or objection by emailing the DPO. You may also contact the Spanish Data Protection Agency (AEPD) or your local authority. We respond within thirty days unless the request is complex.

## Cookies, analytics, and Consent Mode v2

Our cookie notice lives at /cookies. Analytics and advertising tags observe Consent Mode v2 so behaviour adjusts to your choices. Until you agree, tags run in limited mode. We follow the current AEPD cookie guidance for Spain.

## Products and services covered

The list below stays in sync with our central configuration so every live product and service appears here without manual edits.
